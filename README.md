## Overview and Origin

Vurvey is an AI Market Research firm, within the broader market research industry. The company was founded in 2021 by Chad Reynolds in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is built upon the video survey capabilities established in Reynolds' prior firm, Batterri.

Reynolds gave an interview to Kathryn Joyce with Wired Magazine in 2020. There, he explained his spiritual roots behind his entrepreneurship, and Joyce tells his story this way:

> In 2012, CHAD Reynolds found himself on a South Carolina beach at midnight. He was there for a destination wedding, sitting on the sand with friends, when he decided to wade into the ocean alone. As he floated in the dark water, he had what he describes as his first real conversation with God. What was he doing with his life? he asked. Why wasn't he with someone? Why did he feel so empty?

> As he bobbed in the dark Atlantic, Reynolds says, he heard a message in reply: that God had given him talents and gifts so they could be put to use helping other people, and that he needed to be more aggressive about doing so—that, in effect, he had to take a leap of faith. God's side of that midnight conversation was half encouragement, half dare: “Even though you can't see the bottom, I've got you; I'm going to protect you; I'm going to help you.”
>
>When he got back to work, Reynolds recommitted himself to his company. His second startup was called Batterii, a consumer research firm that recruits civilians to provide personalized feedback to brands via smartphone videos. Reynolds, who describes his midnight conversion as “getting an upgrade to his operating system,” came to see the mission of his own company as a way of fulfilling the charge God had given him. If he'd been burned out before by trying to do too much on his own, his work now was to facilitate other people's creativity by building a technology that brings a whole community into the design process.

Vurvey is thenext generation AI-driven descendent of Batterri and has independently raised north of $1M over two funding rounds with the Eagle Venture Fund. The most recent round was in November 2023.

## Business Activities

Market research is generally divided into two methodologies -- qualitative research and quantitative research -- and both come with benefits and limitations. Quantitative research is typically performed at scale and allows for a great deal of generalizability. When you read about research that applies broadly to a large group of people -- say, a pre-election poll that is forecasting election results -- quantitative methods are at play. The power behind this generalizability is limited by the ability to ask only a consistent and discrete set of questions, which need to be composed very carefully, as surveys are generally completed by respondents without anyone on hand to clarify the meaning or intent of the question.

Many qualitative research methods, on the other hand, allow a direct line of questioning that can be modified in real-time to achieve better results, which often take the form of respondents own words. This context-rich data provides the opportunity to find nuanced insights. The limitation is the scale human scale the research requires. Someone must listen and understand what is being said, transcribe or encode the responses, and then look across all of the responses for themes and insights. A researcher conducting such an effort can only reasonably handle a very small number of respondents -- usually in the low double digits. A study this small is not generalizable to the broader population, meaning decision makers must conduct confirmatory quantitative research or take a measured risk based on the qualitative results.

Vurvey bring AI language processing capabilities to confront these limitations through three unique offerings:

* **AI-Powered Primary Research:** Video capture at scale within mixed-methods research. Vurvey video-response questions can be embedded in a variety of research methods. The videos themselves are transcribed by AI -- and not just the spoken words, but also the facial expressions or body movements. 
Albert Mehrabian once famously concluded that communication is 55% nonverbal, 38% vocal, and 7% words only. AI that can parse vocal intonations and non-verbal signals, in addition to the words, allow for qualitative research to be done at scale, which solves for issues of generalizability.

* **Research-Trained LLMs:** In addition to replacing the many hours of a research analyst transcribing and coding data, the current research data, plus all prior research data (both primary and secondary research) can be used to train an LLM allowing researchers to "talk to" their data and combine insights from multiple sources. Within the research, AI personas can be created, as well, based on the consolidated responses from a group of a like-minded individuals.

* **Multi-Modal AI Agents:** Lastly, Vurvey has a multi-modal agent workflow. Recent research conducted with Adidas sought to gather feedback on shoe preferences. Those preferences were then fed through a series of AI agents -- one to code the videos and generate themes, one (or more including personas) to compare the research themes with insights from a variety of additional sources and make recommendations, one to use the recommendations to create two-dimensional renderings of the new shoe designs, and finally one to translate the two-dimension designs into a three-dimensional (and AR ready) image. And then those new designs can be put back into another round of research. Start to finish, what used to take six to nine months can now be completed in less than two weeks.

Vurvey’s intended customers are businesses and organizations that are looking to gather insights and innovate1. This includes companies that want to understand their customers better, test new concepts, and co-create with their users1. They serve a wide range of industries, from consumer goods to technology and beyond.
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

Vurvey operates in the field of market research and is particularly focused on the area of consumer insights. They have developed an AI-driven consumer insights platform that leverages video surveys and artificial intelligence to generate insights and foster innovation. This places them in the broader industry of market research and survey software.

Over the last five to ten years, the field of market research has seen several major trends and innovations:
* **Increased Adoption of AI:** The adoption of AI in market research has more than doubled since 2017. AI is being used to analyze data, predict trends, and provide insights in a way that was not possible before. Generative AI has made a significant impact in market research as it has the potential to generate new ideas and concepts, and can handle difficult transcription and coding at scale.
* **Process Automation and Virtualization:** Around half of all existing work activities could be automated in the next few decades. This includes tasks in market research, such as data collection and analysis.
* **The Future of Connectivity:** Faster digital connections, powered by 5G and the IoT, have the potential to unlock economic activity. This includes the ability to conduct market research in real-time and gather data from a wide range of sources.
* **Emotional Measurement:** Understanding the emotional responses of consumers has become increasingly important in market research. This involves using techniques such as sentiment analysis to gauge how consumers feel about a product or brand.
* **Agile Market Research:** Agile methodologies, which involve iterative and flexible approaches to work, have been adopted in market research3. This allows researchers to adapt quickly to changes and deliver results faster.

While the Market Research industry is large, with stalwarts such as Gallup, Pew, Socratic, CMB and Ipsos, AI is bringing new firms to the forefront. Vurvey is joined in the market research industry by several notable competitors:

* **Perplexity.ai:** Perplexity is a market research tool that provides a clean and easy-to-use interface. Its key advantage over traditional models is its ability to deliver more precise, context-aware responses by integrating direct internet browsing capabilities within its system.
* **Aomni:** Aomni is an innovative AI agent for B2B sales. It excels in aggregating extensive internet data points to provide comprehensive reports, saving significant research time for sales professionals.
* **Exploding Topics:** Exploding Topics is a trend-spotting and social listening platform. They use AI to source their data and then verify its accuracy and relevance with the help of human data analysis experts.
* **Gong:** Gong is an advanced AI-powered call recording and customer intelligence platform. Sales, marketing, and research teams can use Gong to record video and audio from calls with customers or survey participants. Gong will automatically transcribe your calls and produce AI-generated summaries.


## Results

While it is difficult to measure the impact that Vurvey has made on the industry through its innovative approach, there are a couple case studies they highlight to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods.

* **Unilever:** Vurvey partnered with Unilever to launch an award-winning consumer brand. They engaged a multicultural community of consumers throughout the entire product creation process to ensure their new line of products addressed consumer needs and delivered on the promised benefits. This process helped Unilever work through setbacks in production and launch an entire movement.




* **Adidas:** Adidas partnered with Vurvey to co-create a successful running shoe. They developed communities in London, Paris, Berlin, and LA with Vurvey and together with influencers, they developed a new style of soccer cleat from the ground up. This process changed how Adidas approached their production and marketing efforts and created an award-winning product.

## Recommendations

The recommendation that I have actually made to Vurvey directly is leveraging AI to not just transcribe and encode content, but to engage in a discovery process with respondents by creating the questions in the first place. Research moves forward on a data discovery pathway and an AI research agent couple be developed to navigate that data discover pathway, not unlike how a self-driving car is able to navigate a physical environment. Self-driving cars must learn how to operate the vehicle when someone unexpectedly steps off a curb. Similarly, an AI research agent could learn to ask material and probing questions, appropriately in an interview context, that then \(possibly) creates the research data the human researchers are seeking.

This would requiring engineering the AI agents to not just respond to a prompt, but to create a prompt of their own and elicit a response from the survey participant. To my knowledge, this has not been done before, but the analogues of AI decision making exist.
